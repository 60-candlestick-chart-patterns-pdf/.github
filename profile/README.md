#### What is a Candlestick Chart?

A candlestick chart is a type of financial chart. It is used to track the price movements of an asset. Each candlestick represents the opening, closing, high, and low prices of the asset within a selected time frame. These charts are widely used in stock, forex, and cryptocurrency trading.

A candlestick has two main parts:

1. **Body**: The rectangular area showing the open and close prices.
2. **Wicks (or Shadows)**: The thin lines above and below the body. These show the highest and lowest prices.

The body can be green or red (sometimes white and black). A green body shows the price went up, while a red body shows the price went down.
